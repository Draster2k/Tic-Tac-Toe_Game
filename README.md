# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using Pygame

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Pygame. It allows two players to play the game, displaying the current player's move and checking for wins or draws. When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message is displayed on the screen.

## Setup and Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install Pygame using:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Run the game using:
   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## Game Mechanics
The game consists of a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in empty cells. The game checks for a win when three of the same symbols are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or it checks for a draw if all cells are filled.

## The Game Code:
```python
import pygame
import sys

#start pygame
pygame.init()

#screen settings
screen_width=600
screen_hight=600
line_color=(0,0,0)
bg_color=(255,255,255)
line_width=15

#create the screen
screen=pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width,screen_hight))
pygame.display.set_caption("Tic-Tac-Toe")

#set the background color
screen.fill(bg_color)

#Game Variables

    #Horisontal Lines
    pygame.draw.line(screen,line_color,(0,200),(screen_hight,200),line_width)
    pygame.draw.line(screen,line_color,(0,400),(screen_hight,400),line_width)

## Steps to Create the Tic-Tac-Toe Game

1. **Set Up the Project Environment**
   - Install Python if not already installed.
   - Install Pygame using `pip install pygame`.
   - Create a new Python file, e.g., `tic_tac_toe.py`.

2. **Initialize Pygame and Set Up the Window**
   - Import the necessary libraries (`pygame` and `sys`).
   - Initialize Pygame with `pygame.init()`.
   - Set up the screen dimensions and create a Pygame window using `pygame.display.set_mode()`.

3. **Define Game Variables**
   - Set up variables for screen dimensions, colors, and line widths.
   - Initialize a 3x3 grid to represent the game board.
   - Create a variable to track the current player (e.g., "X" or "O").

4. **Draw the Grid**
   - Write a function `draw_grid()` to draw vertical and horizontal lines, dividing the screen into a 3x3 grid.

5. **Handle Player Input**
   - Add event handling for mouse clicks.
   - Write a function `handle_click(x, y)` to determine which cell was clicked and update the board if the cell is empty.

6. **Draw X and O Symbols on the Board**
   - Create a `draw_symbols()` function to iterate over the board and draw the appropriate symbol (X or O) based on the boardâ€™s state.

7. **Switch Between Players**
   - Add functionality to switch the current player after each valid move.

8. **Check for a Win Condition**
   - Implement a `check_win()` function that checks if a player has three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

9. **Check for a Draw Condition**
   - Implement a `check_draw()` function to detect if all cells are filled and no player has won.

10. **Display the Result**
    - Set up a font for rendering text messages.
    - Write a `show_message(message)` function to display a message indicating the winner or a draw.

11. **Reset the Game**
    - Implement a `reset_game()` function to reset the board and switch back to the starting player after a win or draw.

12. **Create the Main Game Loop**
    - In the main loop, handle events for quitting, mouse clicks, and updating the screen.
    - Check for win or draw conditions after each move.
    - Call functions to draw the grid, symbols, and display the result if the game ends.

13. **Test the Game**
    - Run the game to ensure all features work as expected.
    - Debug any issues and make necessary adjustments.

14. **Document the Project**
    - Create a `README.md` file to document the game, its features, and how to run it.
    - Include explanations for key sections of the code and list any future improvements.
